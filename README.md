Collection of my implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms

In reverse chronological order:

- [Linear function approximation with mountain car](https://github.com/xysun/rl-algorithms/blob/master/linear_fa_mountain_car.py): under heavy refactoring right now, but works

    - learning rate is important
    - epsilon decay is important
- [Q-learning](https://github.com/xysun/rl-algorithms/blob/master/q_learning.py)
- [Sarsa](https://github.com/xysun/rl-algorithms/blob/master/sarsa.py)
- [Monte Carlo Prediction & Control with Exploring Starts](https://github.com/xysun/rl-algorithms/blob/master/Monte-Carlo-Prediction-and-Control-with-Exploring-Starts.ipynb)
  - reproduced black jack solution from Sutton book
- [Policy evaluation & iteration, value iteration](https://github.com/xysun/rl-algorithms/blob/master/Policy-evaluation-Policy-iteration-and-Value-Iteration.ipynb)
